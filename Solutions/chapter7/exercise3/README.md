# An ELF Parasite

Write your own ELF parasite and use elfinject to inject it into a program
of your choice. See whether you can make the parasite fork off a child
process that opens a backdoor. Bonus points if you can create a modiﬁed
copy of ps that doesn’t show the parasite process in the process listing.
