# Confusing a Recursive Disassembler

Write another program, this time so that it tricks your favorite recursive
disassemblerâ€™s function detection algorithm. There are various ways to do
this. For instance, you could create a tail-called function or a function
that has a switch with multiple return cases. See how far you can go with
confusing the disassembler!
